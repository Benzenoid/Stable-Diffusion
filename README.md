# Project Overview

This project involves the implementation and exploration of various machine learning models and techniques, particularly focusing on attention mechanisms, generative models, and model conversion/loading processes. It includes scripts and notebooks for tasks such as image-to-image translation, text-to-image generation, and the usage of pre-trained models for different applications.

## Project Outputs

### Text2Image
Text-to-Image generation takes a textual prompt and starts with an image filled with noise, iteratively refining it to produce an image that matches the description provided in the prompt.
